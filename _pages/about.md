I am currently a Research Assistant in the [Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/) at Northeastern University, under the supervision of Professor [Robert Platt](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/). My research focuses on data-efficient robot learning and closed-loop control with feedback, with a particular emphasis on contact-rich manipulation.
